## About 📋

MovieTrends is an app, in which you can see information about the movies that are in trend, and add your favorites in your browser.

This project was made for practical purposes, especially the state management between components, through the React props.

The information is extracted from an API (TheMovieDB) through Axios. The add to favorites functionality was coded using localStorage.
